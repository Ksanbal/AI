    "## The Delegation Run\n",
    "\n",
    "If classes are objects what is the difference between types and instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "When I talk about \"my cat\" I am referring to a concrete instance of the \"cat\" concept, which is a _subtype_ of \"animal\". So, despite being both objects, while types can be _specialized_, instances cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually an object B is said to be a specialization of an object A when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* B has all the features of A\n",
    "* B can provide new features\n",
    "* B can perform some or all the tasks performed by A in a different way\n",
    "\n",
    "Those targets are very general and valid for any system and the key to achieve them with the maximum reuse of already existing components is _delegation_. Delegation means that an object shall perform only what it knows best, and leave the rest to other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delegation can be implemented with two different mechanisms: _composition_ and _inheritance_. Sadly, very often only inheritance is listed among the pillars of OOP techniques, forgetting that it is an implementation of the more generic and fundamental mechanism of delegation; perhaps a better nomenclature for the two techniques could be _explicit delegation_ (composition) and _implicit delegation_ (inheritance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that, again, when talking about composition and inheritance we are talking about focusing on a behavioural or structural delegation. Another way to think about the difference between composition and inheritance is to consider if the object _knows_ who can satisfy your request or if the object _is_ the one that satisfy the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please, please, please do not forget composition**: in many cases, composition can lead to simpler systems, with benefits on maintainability and changeability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually composition is said to be a very generic technique that needs no special syntax, while inheritance and its rules are strongly dependent on the language of choice. Actually, the strong dynamic nature of Python softens the boundary line between the two techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance Now\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python a class can be declared as an _extension_ of one or more different classes, through the _class inheritance_ mechanism. The child class (the one that inherits) has the same internal structure of the parent class (the one that is inherited), and for the case of multiple inheritance the language has very specific rules to manage possible conflicts or redefinitions among the parent classes. A very simple example of inheritance is"

In this case if you decide to use a new parent class you have to manually propagate the change to every method that calls it. Moreover, since in Python the class hierarchy can be dynamically changed (i.e. at runtime), this form of explicit delegation could be not only annoying but also wrong.\n",
